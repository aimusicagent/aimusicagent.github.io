                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Generative AI is reshaping music creation, but its rapid growth exposes structural gaps in attribution, 
                    rights management, and economic models. Unlike past media shifts—from live performance to recordings, downloads, and streaming—AI
                    transforms the entire lifecycle of music, collapsing boundaries between creation, distribution, and monetization. 
                    However, existing streaming systems, with opaque and concentrated royalty flows, are ill-equipped to handle the scale and complexity
                    of AI-driven production.</p>
                
                <p>We propose a content-based Music AI Agent architecture that embeds attribution directly into the creative workflow through block-level retrieval 
                    and agentic orchestration. Designed for iterative, session-based interaction, 
                    the system organizes music into granular components (Blocks) stored in BlockDB; 
                    each use triggers an Attribution Layer event for transparent provenance and real-time settlement.</p>
                
                <p>This framework reframes AI from a generative tool into infrastructure for a Fair AI
                    Media Platform. By enabling fine-grained attribution, equitable compensation, and
                    participatory engagement, it points toward a post-streaming paradigm where music
                    functions not as a static catalog but as a collaborative and adaptive ecosystem.</p>

                            answer: "Okay, since you said you wanted to make Afrobeat music, I prepared two rhythm tracks with that exact feeling! 🥁✨<br>I'm currently working on the verse section, so I approached it with a focus on percussion that would fit that mood.<br>The first option is a very energetic rhythm with congas, bongos, and djembe layered with hi-hats, snares, and kicks. The shakers and tambourines are naturally placed on top, creating an energetic yet smooth groove overall.<br>The second option is a warm and organic rhythm with a combination of kicks, snares, rims, hi-hats, bongos, and congas. The kick firmly holds the groove, and the overall vibe is more natural and refreshing.<br>Since the song is still in its infancy, I think the first option, which has a lot of energy, will suit the verse better! I think starting like this will immediately convey the liveliness that is characteristic of Afrobeat. What do you think?<br>Which rhythm do you like better, the first or the second, or should I try something completely different? Let me know what you think!",

It'll create a rich, immersive atmosphere for the song.<br>The second is a synth bass, with a soft, vibrant tone that mixes traditional Afrobeat with an Afro-Cuban feel. The rhythmic syncopation and melody add to the overall lively, groovy vibe!<br>Since we only have percussion, I think the second synth bass, which can bring out the overall energy and liveliness, would be a better fit for our current goal. It'll definitely capture the characteristic upbeat and soulfulness of Afrobeat!<br>Which bassline do you prefer, or should we try something new? Let me know what you think.",

Bright-toned strums surround the rhythm, while the leisurely melody line adds a warm feeling to the song.<br>The second option is a cheerful and funky guitar riff that is characteristic of Afrobeat. The fast, clear strumming and clever single notes combine to bring the track to life.<br>Our track has a nice groove so far with the percussion and 808 bass, so I think the second, more rhythmic guitar would really liven up the overall vibe.

The dynamic swells and delicate vibrato that appear frequently add a rich atmosphere and energy to the song.<br><br>The second is a gently flowing flute solo, with an airy and clear melody that floats lightly over the groove.

This melody adds liveliness and a dreamy feeling to the track.<br><br>So far, I think the balance of the track between the drums, bass guitar, electric guitar, and this emotional saxophone is just right, completing the modern yet warm mood of the song. I think this combination really captures the jazz fusion feel with the funk rhythm that we were going for!<br><br>Do you have any sections you'd like to move on to next or ideas you'd like to add? Or should we just create the next section?",
